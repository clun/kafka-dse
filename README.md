# DataStax Apache Kafka™ Connector and Reactive Driver

This project is a demo illustrating *DataStax Apache Kafka™ Connector* and the new reactive driver. Stocks valuations events are generated, pushed to Kafka and sent to DataStax Enterprise.

## Overview 

### Architecture

There are 2 ways to run the demo. With and without the connector.

Without the connector you must start the `consumer` :

With the connector only start `producer` and `webui` like the following :

### Maven modules :

- [kafka-dse-core](kafka-dse-core) contains domain beans and utility classes
- [kafka-dse-producer](kafka-dse-producer) is a standalone Spring Boot application that generates random Tick Data load from AlphaVantage and send Json events to kafka topics `stocks_ticks` 
- [kafka-dse-consumer](kafka-dse-consumer) is a standalone Spring Boot application that read from 
- [kafka-dse-webui](kafka-dse-webui) is the standalone web UI.


## Install and run

1. After cloning this project start `kafka` and DataStax components using the following command :
 
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
 You will have access to :
 - [DataStax Studio](http://localhost:9091) : edit the connection to point to `dse` host name of datastax Enterprise
 - [DataStax OpsCenter](http://localhost:8888) : edit the settings to connect to existing cluster on `dse` host. You don't need to install the agents they are already on the dockers images.
 - [KafkaHQ](http://localhost:8080/docker-kafka-server/topic), a web ui to look into Kafka topics.

2. Start the `kafka-dse-producer` component. Open the folder `kafka-dse-producer` and execute the following

```
mvn spring-boot:run 
```

This will create the keySpace `demo_kafka` if needed, and the expected tables `stocks_infos` and `stocks_ticks`. `stocks_infos` is loaded with a list of Stocks codes to be retrieved.

To see incoming event in the topic you can use the [KafkaHQ UI](http://localhost:8080/docker-kafka-server/topic) and use the embedded tool provided by Kafka:

```
docker exec -i -t kafka-dse_kafka_1 kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --from-beginning --topic stocks_ticks
```

You should see something like

```

3. Start the `kafka-dse-webui` component. 

Open the folder kafka-dse-webui :

```
mvn spring-boot:run 
```

You will have access to :
- [The web UI](http://localhost:8082) user interface to see charts


You can start `kafka-dse-consumer` component using again `spring-boot:run` and see events coming in Datastax Enterprise and the UI but this one is only for test. You want to use the sink.

4. Download the *DataStax Apache Kafka™ Connector* from [academy.datastax.com] and put the library in `kafka-dse-sink` folder here. Then execute the following :

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-connect.yml up
```

Kafka-Connect is starting. You can in the log that the class `com.datastax.kafkaconnector.DseSinkConnector` is detected in the classpath. When the service is up (http interface is OK) we register the sink using a POST query.

You can have a look to the [mapping here](docker-compose-connect.yml)
